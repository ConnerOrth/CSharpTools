# CSharpTools
Useful Tools for C#

## Intro
I created this repo to have a place to publish my tools that I make for C# as I need them. The goal of the
repo is to create tools that are meant to be useful and reusable. I will put the licenses to each tool in
its own folder. You can see what I mean below with the JSON tool, which has its own MIT license.

## JSON
This is the first tool that I have created for C# that I am releasing as Open Source under the MIT license
(See the [LICENSE](JSON/LICENSE) file in the JSON folder).

You can view more about the JSON implementation in its [README](JSON/README.md) file.
